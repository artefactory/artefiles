# Pre-commit Setup

This repository comes with an automatic pre-commit configuration that helps maintain code quality across all your Git repositories.

## What is pre-commit?

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework for managing and maintaining Git hooks. It automatically runs a set of checks on your code before each commit, ensuring that your code meets quality standards.

## How It Works

When you run `git init` to create a new repository:

1. The pre-commit hooks are automatically installed in your new repository's `.git/hooks` directory
1. A sample pre-commit configuration file is available at `~/.git_template/pre-commit-config.yaml`

## Setting Up a New Repository

To use pre-commit in a new repository:

1. Copy the sample configuration:

   ```bash
   cp ~/.git_template/pre-commit-config.yaml .pre-commit-config.yaml
   ```

1. Customize the hooks as needed for your project

1. Start committing! The hooks will run automatically.

## Included Hooks

The sample configuration includes the following hooks:

### Code Quality

- `trailing-whitespace`: Trims trailing whitespace
- `end-of-file-fixer`: Ensures files end with a newline
- `check-yaml`: Validates YAML files
- `check-added-large-files`: Prevents committing large files accidentally
- `check-merge-conflict`: Ensures merge conflicts aren't committed

### Python

- `ruff`: Fast Python linter and formatter
- `ruff-format`: Formats Python code

### Shell

- `shellcheck`: Finds bugs and suggestions for shell scripts

### Git

- `conventional-pre-commit`: Enforces conventional commit message format
  - Supported types: feat, fix, chore, test

## Customizing the Configuration

Edit your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to add or remove hooks as needed. Visit [pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com/) for more available hooks.

## Troubleshooting

If you ever need to bypass pre-commit (not recommended for normal use):

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

If pre-commit is not installed, the global hooks will guide you to install it with:

```bash
uv pip install pre-commit
```
